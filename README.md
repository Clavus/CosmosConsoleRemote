# Cosmos Console Remote

This console client can connect to a Cosmos Console server instance running inside a game to send commands.

## Usage

## Developers

This app is build using [AvaloniaUI](https://avaloniaui.net/) and uses [LiteNetLib](https://github.com/RevenantX/LiteNetLib).

The intent is for developers to be able to fork this repo and create a standalone console client with their own game branding to distribute to their players.
